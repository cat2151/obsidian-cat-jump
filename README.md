# obsidian-cat-jump

## Status
- WIP. It should be installable via BRAT, but this is still under investigation.

## Overview
- obsidian-cat-jump is an Obsidian community plugin that allows you to quickly jump your cursor to any location within a note.

## Usage
### Installation
- Install via BRAT.
- Register the command to a hotkey.

### How to use
- When you press the hotkey, labels will appear.
- Press the key corresponding to a label, and your cursor will jump to that label's location.

## Features
- Low learning curve. Labels are arranged in a-z order, making it easy to predict their location.
- Simple. Labels are only displayed at the beginning of lines within the visible area of the note, making the behavior easy to anticipate.
- Fold-aware. Only unfurled/unfolded sections are labeled, allowing for intuitive operation.
- Suitable for long documents. Ideal for navigating within daily notes or long notes that lack a header structure.
- No modifier keys. For frequent jumping, it avoids using SHIFT or CTRL keys, restricting input to a-z keys only, thereby reducing strain on your fingers.
