## Features
- Easy. Labels are arranged in a-z order, making it easy to predict locations and allowing for immediate use with a low learning curve.
- Folding-aware. It only labels unfolded sections, allowing for intuitive operation.
- Long documents. It is suitable for navigating between locations without a header structure, such as daily notes or other long documents.
- No modifiers. It avoids the high-effort SHIFT and CTRL keys, allowing operation solely with a-z key combinations, thus reducing strain on your fingers.

Note: To be transferred from recursive-folding.
